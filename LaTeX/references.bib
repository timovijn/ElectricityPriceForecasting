abstract = {Most of our training and experience is geared towards static situations, that is, events where things change so slowly that we can think of them as being independent of time. We are aware of dynamic situations of course --automobile crashes, aircraft accidents, industrial accidents, natural phenomena such as tornadoes bearing an assortment of debris, damage from hurricanes and tropical storms to name but a few. Still, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, we manage to experience these and go on as though they had no effect on our approach to solving problems. When dealing with short-term effects, however, we must change our way of looking at the world. Much of the intuition we have developed based on a static view of events fails us when considering truly dynamic problems. It now becomes necessary to be cognizant of two very important factors: (a) the rate at which our observed phenomenon changes; (b) the fact that information is propagated at a finite speed. In mechanical systems, this means taking into account both strain rate and wave propagation effects. What we observe as rigid body motion is actually the net result of many, many wave reflections. Think of it as the long-term solution for problems of intense impact or impulsive loading. Rigid-body impacts, especially as they apply to robotics, are covered very lucidly by Brach [1991]. A very valuable addition to the literature is the text by Stronge [2000]. This approach is useful for a variety of low-speed collisions m hammers on nails, hail on roof tops, athletic balls on floors and walls, screen doors, vehicles, typewriter carriages, dot matrix printers, shot peening, solid particles in multi-phase flows and others. The classic theory follows directly from Newton' s laws of motion. More often than not, the problem is formulated in terms of nonlinear differential equations. However, the equations of impulse and momentum are algebraic and almost always linear. This formal approach is coupled to reality through coefficients of restitution and friction. This removes much mathematical unpleasantness while making the theory a tractable and useful engineering tool. Rigid-body mechanics does not take into account the internal 33},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION In an impact condition of a mechanical system, traditional static solid mechanics approaches are invalid as they do not account for the dynamic response of the system. Methodologies that account for the dynamic stress/strain effects are namely stereomechanics, energy method, contact mechanics, and stress wave propagation. This chapter presents the fundamental governing equations for mechanical stress wave propagation within engineering solids due to an impact or sudden loading event. The response of an impacted solid depends on the energy of the striking body, which results in the initiation of elastic stress waves for a low-energy impact, plastic wave propagation for high intensity impacts, and hydrodynamic behavior of solids for higher intensity impacts. The basic wave equation is presented in this chapter for a one-dimensional case along with the impacted medium's properties which influence wave propagation. The concept of wave impedance is discussed along with the continuity equations of wave motion at boundary conditions for force, stress and velocities. Developments of transmission and reflection coefficients are shown. Impact conditions for elastic, plastic and shock waves are presented. Application of the stress wave theory for impact analysis will be demonstrated on the use of the Split Hopkinson Bar (SHB) test. From this experimental impact test, the dynamic stress-strain response of the material can be determined. Stress, strain and strain rate equations for the tested medium are developed as well as the transmission and reflection of the stress wave. The advantage of stress wave method is an accurate stress analysis on the impacted elastic solid. In addition, the variation of local strain/stress levels in the solid can be identified as a function of time and space. On the other hand, stress wave propagation is highly mathematical and requires a large amount of simplification of the impacted mechanical system. In engineering applications where complex geometries are involved, the stress wave method can be captured by the use of explicit finite element analysis (FEA). The use of Finite Element Methods (FEM) will be discussed in this chapter illustrating stress wave propagating in solids under impact conditions. FEM parameters such as contact methodologies, element selection, material constitutional equations, boundary conditions and proper incremental time step will be examined to generate accurate engineering modeling of the strains and stresses in wave propagation. Both a simple bar impact and the SHB test are examined using FEM techniques.},

abstract = {The stress wave caused by a longitudinal impact at the end of a cylindrical bar has been analyzed in the case where the impact velocity is large enough to produce plastic strain. The theory gives a method for com-puting the stress distribution along the bar at any instant during impact. It is shown that for a given material, there is a critical impact velocity such that when subjected to a tension impact with a velocity higher than the critical, the material should break near the impacted end with negligible plastic strain. An experimental investigation was made concurrently with the theoretical study. Some of the most significant experimental results are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Wave propagation in infinite or unbounded domains is often encountered in scientific and engineering applications. Theoretical fundamentals and applications of a new numerical model which has the ability to simulate such wave propagation are presented. Attention is focused on linear waves in ideal fluids and elastic domains. Wave propagation based on scalar and vector wave equations, as well as fluid-structure interaction and soil-structure interaction is numerical simulated. The model is based on a coupled finite element/scaled boundary finite element method (FEM/SBFEM). While the FEM maps the near-field, under the immense variety of non-reflecting boundary conditions the SBFEM, developed by Wolf and Song, was chosen. It has some unique features: reduction of the spatial dimension by one without requiring a fundamental solution, no discretisation of free and fixed boundaries and interfaces between different materials, and influence of the infinite far-field could be stored in the form of matrices for further simulations (e.g., different load cases). Benchmark examples show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Finally, covered fields of applications are: acoustics, dynamic behaviour of offshore wind turbines, and seismic analysis of buildings including soil-structure interaction. pt. 1. Theory -- pt. 2.

UHMWPE has a superior wear resistance, low-friction surface, biological inertness, high levels of strength, creep resistance and low friction coefficient. However, the wear debris generated during the joint motions could cause problem in human implant, such as osteolysis and loosening. For this, several attempts was been made to improve UHMWPE properties and increases safety and biocompatibility in human implants. One of them, include the use of hydroxyapatite (HA), as reinforcement agent to modify the UHMWPE properties and facilitate biological fixation between the implant and the human cells. Recent studies showed that the addition of HA in polymer matrix result in enhancement of mechanical and tribological properties. In addition, it also improves the formation of the actual bond between the material and the living organism since the hydroxyapatite is the major component of the mineral part of the human bone. In this brief review the some properties and characteristic of UHMWPE and HA are described and main processing methods of UHMWPE/HA composites and biocompatibility studies were also reviewed.},
